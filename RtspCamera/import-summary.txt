ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* docs/
* docs/wire-udp4000-h264-with-inband-sps.pps-nativeencoder.pcap
* gpl.txt
* proguard.cfg

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* jni/ => app/src/main/jni/
* libs/armeabi/libH263Decoder.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi/libH263Decoder.so
* libs/armeabi/libH263Encoder.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi/libH263Encoder.so
* libs/armeabi/libH264Decoder.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi/libH264Decoder.so
* libs/armeabi/libH264Encoder.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi/libH264Encoder.so
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/
* src/com/orangelabs/rcs/service/api/client/media/IMediaEventListener.aidl => app/src/main/aidl/com/orangelabs/rcs/service/api/client/media/IMediaEventListener.aidl
* src/com/orangelabs/rcs/service/api/client/media/IMediaPlayer.aidl => app/src/main/aidl/com/orangelabs/rcs/service/api/client/media/IMediaPlayer.aidl
* src/com/orangelabs/rcs/service/api/client/media/IMediaRenderer.aidl => app/src/main/aidl/com/orangelabs/rcs/service/api/client/media/IMediaRenderer.aidl
* src/com/orangelabs/rcs/service/api/client/media/MediaCodec.aidl => app/src/main/aidl/com/orangelabs/rcs/service/api/client/media/MediaCodec.aidl

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
